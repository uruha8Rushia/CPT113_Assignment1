## üîç Assignment Overview  
The objective of the assigment is to design and implement an object-oriented program for managing Eid cookies and cakes sales. The program allows users to define multiple cookie and cake types, set pricing based on per-piece or weight basis, and apply special discounts. The main goal is to showcase a strong understanding of object-oriented programming concepts by designing meaningful relationships between classes.

The program must:
- Utilize **file handling** for persistent data storage.
- Implement **multiple class relationships** with concepts such as inheritance and composition.
- Support **user interactivity** with a menu-driven interface.
- Be **well-documented** using text cells in a Jupyter Notebook format.
- Include a **UML diagram** illustrating class structures and relationships.

## üí° Concepts Used
This program extensively applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** to design a structured and efficient system for cookie and cake sales. The following concepts are incorporated:

- **Classes & Objects**: Encapsulation of attributes and behaviors in well-defined classes.
- **Inheritance**: Parent-child relationships between classes to promote code reuse.
- **Composition**: Private object declarations within a class to model stronger relationships.
- **Friend Functions**: Used in a justified manner to allow controlled access between classes.
- **Operator Overloading**: Enhancing class functionalities with custom operators.
- **Encapsulation & Information Hiding**: Ensuring data security by restricting direct access to class attributes.
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing data to a text file for persistent storage.
- **Input Validation**: Ensuring correct user input through validation mechanisms.
- **Menu-Driven Interface**: Interactive prompts for user navigation.
- **Multiple File Inclusion**: Structuring the code across multiple files for better readability.
- **Testing & Debugging**: A single object is utilized in `main()` to showcase program functionalities.

This project is designed to reflect **real-world programming principles**, ensuring code clarity, maintainability, and functional correctness within an **object-oriented environment**.
